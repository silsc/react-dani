My work is to define a unique vision for every band and make the hard decisions, both musical and sonically, for the project to be successful. It's easy to be ignored on Spotify.

    "text-2": "Music is way more than sounding great. You have to write good music, play it right, have a vision, design cool merch, interesting videoclips, finding shows, promote yourself well, etc. Its intimidating, and my goal is to help the bands in evey step of the way to create the best possible product.",
    "text-3": "Every day over 60k songs get uploaded to Spotify (thats not a typo!) and its really easy to be ignored. I want to work with bands who want to change the industry, improve with every album, talk real and important matters and, above all, make the effort, music and art worth it."

Another thing to point out is that you won't leave the studio without learning something. We (The Fox 196) are proud of his work and sharing the passion he has for music.",
