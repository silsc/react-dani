My work is to define a unique vision for every band and make the hard decisions, both musical and sonically, for the project to be successful. It's easy to be ignored on Spotify. If you believe in your music, it deserves to be listened to."

I believe musicians need to know how to produce themselves and have a vision, but it’s difficult to get good results, and you need someone that knows how to give the sound the necessary impact and energy. If you haven't started the project yet, I can advice during the whole process to make the right calls."

    "text-1": "I've been writing music and playing in bands for as long as I can remember, and I know just how difficult it is for people to take you seriously as an artist and be interested in your music. Since I started producing a few years ago, besides sound, my main obsession has been to learn how the fuck I can help the bands move their careers forward.",
    "text-2": "Music is way more than sounding great. You have to write good music, play it right, have a vision, design cool merch, interesting videoclips, finding shows, promote yourself well, etc. Its intimidating, and my goal is to help the bands in evey step of the way to create the best possible product.",
    "text-3": "Every day over 60k songs get uploaded to Spotify (thats not a typo!) and its really easy to be ignored. I want to work with bands who want to change the industry, improve with every album, talk real and important matters and, above all, make the effort, music and art worth it."

One of his best virtues is his great technical training with international producers, which lets you know different techniques and more optimized methods you don't find in other local studios. Another thing to point out is that you won't leave the studio without learning something. We (The Fox 196) are proud of his work and sharing the passion he has for music.",

He has shown me how to open your mind in regards to songwriting, I have improved my guitar playing with his tips and, most importantly, is how open and coherent he is when talking about your music.
